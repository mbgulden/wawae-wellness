body: "Foot Zoning is also known as European Reflexology. It is an amazing technology involving my hands and your feet. With a massaging motion, we are able to signal the entire body and their systems through the foot. Its purpose is to clear and open any blocks of energy or emotions that may have been stored in the body.\r\n\nThe Foot Zone helps bring the body back into a balanced state. Each body responses differently, it is a gentle yet effect practice that will support your ultimate health.\r\n\nMost clients find it beneficial to remain hydrated before and after a session."
